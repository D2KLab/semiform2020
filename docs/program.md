** Keynote Talk: WeVerify: Wider and Enhanced Verification for You **

*Abstract*:

Misinformation being spread online is a great issue in our society, having a negative impact on societal debates, elections, healthcare, among others. Online misinformation can also spread fast, reaching out to millions of people. For instance, misinformation about COVID-19 has reached "misinfodemic" scale, with a worldwide spread similar to the pandemic itself. Fact-checkers are then focusing most of their effort on this topic, although it is not feasible to manually debunk every piece of misinformation. Therefore, in addition to
practical verification skills, journalists and media organisations are increasingly in need of collaborative verification tools, assistance through intelligent algorithms for automatic content verification, and the ability to cross-check quickly whether a given claim or media item has already been proven false by other fact-checking organisations. In
this talk I will present an overview of the WeVerify project and the tools it develops for human-in-the-loop content verification and disinformation analysis. I will focus on our work using Natural Language Processing for detecting and debunking online misinformation. Finally, our work on dealing with COVID-19 misinformation will also be presented.
