# Program

The SEMIFORM workshop will take place on **Monday 2nd November, 2020**. The timetable given below is in Central European Time (Paris) or GMT+1.

- 14:00-14:10: Welcome by the chair
- 14:10-15:00: Keynote Talk - Carolina Scarton (University of Sheffield) - WeVerify: Wider and Enhanced Verification for You
<p class="textblock" markdown="1">
Abstract: Misinformation being spread online is a great issue in our
society, having a negative impact on societal debates, elections,
healthcare, among others. Online misinformation can also spread fast,
reaching out to millions of people. For instance, misinformation about
COVID-19 has reached "misinfodemic" scale, with a worldwide spread
similar to the pandemic itself. Fact-checkers are then focusing most
of their effort on this topic, although it is not feasible to manually
debunk every piece of misinformation. Therefore, in addition to
practical verification skills, journalists and media organisations are
increasingly in need of collaborative verification tools, assistance
through intelligent algorithms for automatic content verification, and
the ability to cross-check quickly whether a given claim or media item
has already been proven false by other fact-checking organisations. In
this talk I will present an overview of the WeVerify project and the
tools it develops for human-in-the-loop content verification and
disinformation analysis. I will focus on our work using Natural
Language Processing for detecting and debunking online misinformation.
Finally, our work on dealing with COVID-19 misinformation will also be
presented.
